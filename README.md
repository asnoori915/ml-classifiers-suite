# ML Classifiers Suite

This project showcases a comprehensive suite of machine learning classifiers implemented entirely from scratch using Python. It includes linear, probabilistic, and tree-based models, applied to real-world datasets.

## 📁 Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for each family of models
  - `linear_models.ipynb`: Perceptron, Logistic Regression
  - `svm_models.ipynb`: Linear Support Vector Machines
  - `naive_bayes_and_decision_tree.ipynb`: Naïve Bayes and Decision Tree
- `data/`: CSV datasets (e.g., COVID-19, mushroom, voting records, etc.)
- `reports/`: Reports written on results

## 🔍 Implemented Algorithms

- Perceptron
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naïve Bayes (with Laplace smoothing)
- Decision Tree (entropy, info gain, depth tuning)

## ✅ Features

- Pure Python implementations (no sklearn model training)
- Real datasets for evaluation
- Accuracy comparisons vs. sklearn equivalents
- Confusion matrices and visual analysis
- Notebook-first workflow (easy to explore and rerun)

## 📊 Datasets Used

- COVID-19 trends
- UCI Mushroom Classification
- UCI Congressional Voting Records

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open any notebook in `notebooks/`.
2. Run all cells to train and evaluate models.
3. Modify datasets or logic as needed to explore.
